                    Advancements in healthcare for the last decade have continuously improved, saving the lives of millions of people. However, despite being one of the most rapidly growing industries in modern society, the healthcare sector still finds many patients struggling to find the personalized healthcare they need.
                </p>

                <p class="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    There are many different evolving technologies attempting to bridge this gap between patient and provider, and The Internet of Things (IoT) is no different. IoT refers to the network of interconnected devices that communicate and share data seamlessly. It has emerged as a revolutionary force, transforming various industries, including the healthcare sector. A subset of IoT technology, known as the Internet of Healthcare Things (IoHT) or the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT), has led to transformative changes; improving patient care, enhancing efficiency, and revolutionizing medical practices.

                {{-- Use Cases Section --}}
                <h4 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 dark:text-white mb-6">Examples of IoT in Healthcare Use Cases</h4>
                <p class="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    The implementation of IoT within the healthcare industry has improved many of the processes in the last few years, and has a lot of potential to improve the way the systems operate in the future. New and innovative inventions are created every day in order to improve the healthcare industry. Some basic operations, such as hardware maintenance, is already available and used by many. Here are some of the essential use cases for IoT within the healthcare sector as utilized in many current healthcare facilities:
                </p>

                {{-- Patient Check-In --}}
                <h5 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 dark:text-white mb-4 mt-8">IoT-Enabled Automated Patient Check-In</h5>
                <p class="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    Traditionally, patient check-in processes involve paperwork, manual verification, and queuing at registration desks; leading to long and unnecessary waiting times. With IoT-enabled patient check-in systems, individuals can complete necessary forms electronically before arriving at the healthcare facility. This online capture of a patient's information should also make it much easier to transfer to a different doctor or hospital. This not only expedites the registration process but also minimizes paperwork-related delays, allowing patients to move seamlessly through the initial stages of their healthcare journey.
                </p>

                {{-- Hardware Maintenance --}}
                <h5 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 dark:text-white mb-4">Hardware Maintenance</h5>
                <p class="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    In the healthcare industry, one of IoT's most important use cases is keeping hardware updated and maintained. Within hospitals, each and every device plays a crucial role in ensuring patients get the care they deserve. Imagine a hospital with hundreds of pieces of medical equipment, all working in harmony to achieve the desired effect - it would be impractical for the staff to keep track of each piece of equipment and when they were last serviced.
                </p>

                <p class="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-8">
                    IoHT plays a crucial role in addressing this challenge, particularly in the tracking and proper maintenance of hardware. This helps ensure that all of the equipment is properly preserved and would also help reduce the risk of breakdowns. In critical settings like hospitals, where timely and reliable equipment operation is a matter of literal life and death, IoHT emerges as a transformative solution.
                </p>

                {{-- Conclusion --}}
                <h4 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 dark:text-white mb-4">Conclusion</h4>
                <p class="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
                    In conclusion, the future of IoT in healthcare is characterized by continued growth and technological advancements, which can hopefully shift toward a more patient-centric and digitally enabled healthcare solutions. From remote patient monitoring to predictive analytics, the advantages are evident - improved patient outcomes, reduced costs, operational efficiency, and a more proactive approach to healthcare. At Greycode, we are continuously conducting research and diving into IoT development and solutions for all sectors.
