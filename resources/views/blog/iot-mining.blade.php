                <p class="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    We are digging, and we have always been digging. From the earliest days of human civilization to the present, the act of extracting valuable resources from the earth has been a constant. And as we look to the future, one thing is clear: we will continue to dig.
                </p>

                <p class="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-8">
                    However, the way we extract minerals is undergoing a monumental shift, thanks to the Internet of Things (IoT). This is not just a subtle change; it's a complete overhaul of traditional mining practices. IoT is bringing a new era of efficiency, safety, and sustainability to mining operations.
